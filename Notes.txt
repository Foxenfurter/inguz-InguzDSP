todo:

dsp: -skip=1:25.53 (etc)

all the weighting etc is busted

plugin graph: separate EQ for each channel

plugin graph: no smoothing in reported json

WaveWriter add filename: when pipe end -> say source or dest (stream, filename)

plugin: nuhi fast-mp3 weirdness

installer 6.5 vs 7.0

==== NEXT:

write AMBU chunk into UHJ decodes (and finish WaveChunk work)

plugin handle .UHJ as like WAV (but potentially different amb decode later)

plugin: WaveInput?

plugin: way to strip down the menus??  EQ "off"?  (nuhi suggestion)

web: demonstrator for the webpage
	(skip ajax stuff; hard-code some play values)

plugin: loudness from 0% to 100% (dsp is ready to handle this)

plugin: flatness from 0% to 100% (dsp is ready to handle this)

web: pull down wavs for octave processing - auto - and publish back as gifs

plugin (later): CLI for RTA (measurement upload, etc)

ambisonic -> aften -> spdif

ImpulsePrep: handle any number of inputs (0 or more)

Analyze impulse response, produce recommendations on room treatment & driver alignment

web: impulseprep doc
	- copy flag
	- uptodate screenshots
	- acourate
	- drc install bits
web: presets doc
web: ambisonic settings doc
web: how it works
web: separate the measurement (with the new test signals)


==== NICE TO HAVE / LATER:

impulseprep: analyse distortion
- and add distortion magnitudes to the impulse... more accurate magnitude correction?

WaveWriter: NormalizationMode (peak, or RMS average...)

dsp: handle 4ch (etc) filter impulses, as placeholder for multich output stuff

stack trace with line numbers?

dsp: licensing

write up the mac install

impulseprep: crash in Prep(), if right impulse is twice length of left

dsp: sox resample: do each channel separately (so we can resample amb etc)

ambisonic: binaural decode
		
ambisonic: crossover filters

ambisonic: two completely separate decode channels (low & hihg freqs) then mix

ambisonic: decode to 5.1 or rectangular, then compress to AC3 with "aften"
	(probably need to SPDIF-WAV-encode afterwards)

new app: siggen

impulseprep: handle any number of channels

dsp/plugin: setting for speaker angle @ listening pos

dsp/plugin: "depth" control via ambisonic transform?

plugin: support RTSP? (alienbbc)

skew: fractional sample skew (requires interpolation... convolve with sinc at nyquist)

new app: waterfall (and other analysis charts),... silverlight?

dsp/plugin: make it easy to not select processing for a particular squeezebox

dsp/plugin: uninstall documentation on web

dsp/plugin: document replaygain (or see what happens? or... handle it?? can wav include replaygain, and can we then re-encode keeping that intact?)

dsp: test vista install (no, someone has same problem on XP!)

dsp: test mac (68k: big-endian)

dsp: sweep: cut of at end?

tools: clean up 'sweep' and release it

flatness: increase resolution as well as intensity

loudness weighting: can we make sure the channels are reasonably well balanced? eg my k measurements.


licensing: server db

licensing: write license.xml


all apps: detect whether run from command prompt vs explorer?

dsp: sig gen: shaped burst

? plugin/dsp: support negative Quietness values

ImpulsePrep: GUI

impulseprep: upload to site

web downloader & processor
	- fetch, to work queue, and commit
	- for each measured impulse, produce graphs
		impulse response time domain
		impulse response frequency domain
		impulse response group delay
		waterfall
		
impulseprep: direct sound by target not by filter?

WaveWriter: make able to write WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE, so we can output B-Format

dsp: A/B/X mode

dsp: resample
	88.2 -> 96 for Transporter (and maybe, other rates to 96?)
	88.2 -> 44.1, 96 -> 48 for SB3
	
dsp: key
	play wav file with 'DISP' chunk containing inguz audio + key
	http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:3uHKgcs7fEsJ:abcavi.kibi.ru/docs/riff1.doc+wav+fmt+data+riff+wave+disp&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=7&gl=us
	
	or WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE with a special guid for me, and the key stashed somewhere else
	
	one key per device (not per server)!
	- need to play the track on the right device (or on a system that knows the right device) to unlock
	
impulseprep: test linux


sample matrix impulses:
	choueiri
	flattened choueiri versions
	
dsp: flatness is broken (quite badly), should be able to invert itself

dsp: write "flatness test" output: should be near-flat (and maybe can optimize flatness by looking for min diff instead??)

ISoundObj.Apply(ISoundObj), alternative to .Input?


? plugin or core: allow separate dsp pipelines for synchronized players?!

? dsp: if (e.g.) ADPCM and "-wav".. what then?
    - can we just pass it through to squeezebox unchanged (bit-for-bit)?

dsp: flatness: make not-linear base?
    - more variation near flat
    - flatten by loudnessness, not linearly across the frequency domain?
        flat 0: original
        flat 1: flattening factor: differential-loudness @ 90-80? ?? (duh)
        flat 10: flat (factor: diffL @ 

SlimCLI package wrap useful stuff

	
	
Auto-process series of sweep recordings
	- assume we want at least 10 sweeps for each channel
	- mark each channel uniquely -- with the pulse?
		- eg. pulse left mark with 600Hz, right with 800?
	
Splice: handle all sorts of input not just raw
Slice, split channels.

Join & Split: separate at given time or sample.

Dither for 32f output
    - error is the same
    - offset is not +/-1, it's +/- 1LSB (whatever that means; 1 * exponent * double.Epsilon? how many sig bits?)

---

x ngen, instead of JIT, should reduce startup time & maybe even get more perf
    (no, basically no difference)

. Combine "deconvolve" and channel-splice for single processing app
    - always aim at flat (or whatever) output - don't fix target here

. Deconvolve: much more memory-efficient
x Deconvolve: output three "target" files corresponding to the room

. inguzdsp: show peak level when done

x Quantizer: convolve with kaiser windowd sinc
	- Parks/McClellan applet http://www.dsptutor.freeuk.com/remez/RemezFIRFilterDesign.html
	- also see http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/mhonarc/openmash-developers/msg01360.html

x ?Oversample the sweep inverse, & the convolution --> higher samplerate impulse??
	- can average & avoid clock skew issues
        -- NO, this doesn't avoid real clock divergence; need to record two tracks.

x DRC: make several target files (times several settings files...?)
    - unequalized room
    - half-way
    - flat
    when deconvolving the sweeps: fft, then find max using third-octave bins

    (extra stuff in deconvolve)

. dsp: on new version, wipe cache (C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\InguzEQ\Temp folder)

. calibration at startup, if not known settings for a given impulse:
      x convolve the impulse with pink noise
            - figure whether 2 or 4 partitions is faster
            - calculate gain (start with big gain, wait long enough for it to adjust down, then to-3dBFS)
        (impl: does flatness filters, and calculates weighted-noise gain for each filter)

. Ship "Quietness_<N>" from 0 to 10,
    with quietness targets (on a ERB scale)... constant-loudness-adjusted
    - as filters?
    - as text files?
    (don't ship them - just regenerate whenever needed for EQ's settings)
