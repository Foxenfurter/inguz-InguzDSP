InguzDSP

InguzDSP is a signal processing plugin for the Squeezebox Server / SqueezeCenter / SlimServer.
It has two parts: InguzEQ (a perl module, which is the plugin) and InguzDSP (a C# application);
they were historically separate because of distinct license models, but now they're both made
available under the open MIT license.  Here they both are.
